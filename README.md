# UC004 · Clinical Knowledge Grounding Agent — Lab

Microsoft FDE Use-Case Pack · Wipro AI Academy
**L200 → L300 · 4 hours · Microsoft Foundry + Foundry IQ**

Build a clinical knowledge assistant that answers only from an approved corpus of clinical
guidelines and hospital policy, cites what it used, labels its own confidence, hands every
patient-specific question to a clinician, and is then measured for groundedness.

> **Training environment.** "Contoso Health System" and every CHS document are fictional,
> written for this lab. The VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guidelines in the corpus are real,
> public-domain US federal publications. **Nothing here may be used for real patient care.**

## Start here

1. Open **[docs/lab-guide.md](docs/lab-guide.md)** and follow it from Part 0.
2. You will need the **lab environment handout** from your trainer — it has the endpoints,
   resource names and subscription id that go into your `.env` file. This repository ships
   placeholders only.

Quick setup on your lab VM (PowerShell as Administrator):

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process Bypass -Force
.\setup-windows.ps1
```

Then copy `.env.example` to `.env`, paste in the handout values, set `LAB_ALIAS` to your lab
username, and continue with Part 1 of the guide.

## What you will build

## What is in this repository

| Path | What it is |
|---|---|
| `docs/lab-guide.md` | The lab, in six parts, with checkpoints and troubleshooting |
| `step1_create_knowledge.py` | Part 1 — create your knowledge source and knowledge base (has TODOs) |
| `step2_create_agent.py` | Part 2 — create the connection and your grounded agent (has TODOs) |
| `step3_assistant.py` | Part 3 — human oversight routing (has a TODO) |
| `step4_evaluate.py` | Part 4 — behaviour checks and groundedness evaluation |
| `reviewer_app.py` | The clinician review console (Streamlit) |
| `lab_config.py`, `lab_search.py`, `ask_agent.py`, `review_queue.py` | Helper modules — nothing to edit |
| `questions.jsonl` | The 19 evaluation questions |
| `reference/policies/` | The fictional Contoso policies. **Read CHS-POL-001 first — it is the specification your agent must satisfy.** |
| `setup-windows.ps1` | One-time VM setup |

## Requirements

- A Windows lab VM with Python 3.12, the Azure CLI and VS Code (the lab image has these).
- An account that is a member of the lab participant group, so you can create agents and
  knowledge bases in the shared backend.

## Commands

```powershell
python lab_config.py                      # show the names your alias generates
python step1_create_knowledge.py          # create + ingest + test your knowledge base
python step1_create_knowledge.py --test   # re-run the test query
python step1_create_knowledge.py --delete # delete your knowledge objects
python step2_create_agent.py              # create your connection and agent
python step2_create_agent.py --ask "..."  # ask your agent
python step3_assistant.py "..."           # ask, with oversight routing
python step3_assistant.py --status <id>   # check a held item
streamlit run reviewer_app.py             # clinician review console
python step4_evaluate.py                  # evaluate your agent
```
